        	<p>I am currently studying in Level 2 of the Interact Media design of Fanshawe Collage. In fact, I didn't think I would learn the coding and edit the webpage before I studied this major. Because I feel that is very difficult when I have not entered professional studies. And when I officially learned this, I think the code is not boring. It is feel wonderful when you write a bunch of code to see that he has a sense of accomplishment on the page. So I hope that I can find related work in the future.</p>

        	<p>The plan of my final assignment, my plan is to complete the Html and css sections first. The first part sorts out all the information as much as possible, and then the second part is to beautify the page. The last step is to add some features to him, which is part of JavaScript. And I think JavaScript is real diffcult.</p>
